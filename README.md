This project creates an environment where Monte Carlo simulations can calculate outcomes of different portfolios. The outcomes differ based on the initial investment, time period invested, the diversification of the portfolio and the number of simulations conducted. 

The investment information is retrieved using two API's: Alpaca Markets API and Alternative Free Crypto API.

The project is divided into 3 parts:
* Personal Finance Planner
* Retirment Planning
* Early Retirement
